{"body":"## Sample Code\r\n\r\n    <label class=\"checkbox\">\r\n      <!--\r\n        Note the data-on and data-off attributes to set text for the states.\r\n        Possible additional classes (alla Bootstrap) are:\r\n          * slidr-info\r\n          * slidr-success\r\n          * slidr-warning\r\n          * slidr-danger\r\n          * slidr-inverse\r\n      -->\r\n      <input type=\"checkbox\">\r\n      <span class=\"slidr\" data-on=\"ON\" data-off=\"OFF\"></span>\r\n      Option one is this and thatâ€”be sure to include why it's great\r\n    </label>\r\n\r\n## Styles\r\n`slidr.css` was built on top of Twitter Bootstrap, therefor I added the default styles which are used for labels, badges, buttons and so on.\r\n\r\n- `.slidr-info`\r\n- `.slidr-success`\r\n- `.slidr-warning`\r\n- `.slidr-danger`\r\n- `.slidr-inverse`\r\n\r\n### Transitions\r\nCurrently transitions on pseudo elements is only available in Firefox and Internet Explorer 10. But in case the Chrome update comes available in the next few weeks I added transitions for all browsers\r\n\r\n## Get Started\r\n1.

Include them as stylesheets in your page.\r\n3. Create a checkbox with the new `slidr` class:\r\n\r\n    <label class=\"checkbox\">\r\n      <input type=\"checkbox\">\r\n      <span class=\"slidr\"></span>\r\n    </label>\r\n\r\n4.
